OCCCL - OCCAM-Pi with openCL

ABSTRACT

AIM

Investiage the feasibility and the performance of opencl/C acceleration on existing pure occam programs.

METHODOLOGY

All startup is done by initial.c. Two methods are provided. initialise() returns a cl_context and cl_device_id which is used to compile the program from src. Each CL program creates its own cl_program_queue at every run of the CL program.

buildcl() builds from src a program which can then be executed by the cl_program_queue

All CL programs are in one .c file with the _init call and the call seperated. The _init needs to run once before the CL program can be executed. There is only a check if it is enabled at compile time.
