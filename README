OCCCL - OCCAM-Pi with openCL

ABSTRACT

AIM

METHODOLOGY

- All startup is done by initial.c. Two methods are provided.

initialise returns a cl_context and cl_device_id which is used to compile the program from src and to create its cl_program_queue in which all compiled opencl programs will run.

buildcl builds from src a program which can then be executed by the cl_program_queue

- Questions:
1. Do we need to make sure we only ever have on cl_program_queue?
2. Should we create one queue per application or add all programs to the queue?
3. Should we precompile all programs before running them and can we 'cache' them or do we need to recompile them every time we scrap context/queue?

- OCCAM
1. parameters and return values from C work ok
2. Find a program that we can optimise with opencl calls - mandelbrot?
2.
